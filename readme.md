This repository will help you get started with building on Dkargo chains with [Dkargo SDK](https://github.com/dKargo/dkargo-sdk). It provides various simple demos showing and explaining how to interact with Dkargo chains â€” deploying and using contracts directly on Dkargo, moving DKA token and ERC20 tokens betweens the arbitrum and dkargo chains, and more.
